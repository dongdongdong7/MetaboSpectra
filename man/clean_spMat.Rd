\usage{
clean_spMat(
  spMat,
  ppm = 5,
  min_mz = -1,
  max_mz = -1,
  noise_threshold = 0.01,
  max_peak_num = -1,
  scale_int = 100,
  normalize_intensity = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spMat}{The matrix from the mass spectrum needs to contain two columns, mz and intensity.}

\item{ppm}{The minimum mz difference in ppm to merge peaks, any two peaks with mz difference < ppm will be merged}

\item{min_mz}{The minimum mz value to keep, set to -1 to disable}

\item{max_mz}{The maximum mz value to keep, set to -1 to disable}

\item{noise_threshold}{The noise threshold, set to -1 to disable, all peaks have intensity < noise_threshold * max_intensity will be removed}

\item{max_peak_num}{The maximum number of peaks to keep, set to -1 to disable}

\item{scale_int}{Normalized target value, set to -1 to disable}

\item{normalize_intensity}{Whether to normalize the intensity to sum to 1}
}
\value{
spMat.
}
\description{
Clean a spMat includes removing noise, merging similar peaks, and intensity normaliaztion.
